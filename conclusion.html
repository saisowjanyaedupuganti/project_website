        <h1>What we learned from the accident data</h1>

        <p>
            The project brought together several views of UK road accidents. Maps helped us
            locate hotspots and areas with frequent multi-vehicle crashes. Bar and pie charts
            showed how accident counts change across days of the week, weather types, light
            conditions and road surfaces. The scatter plot connected the number of vehicles
            involved with the number of casualties.

        <p>
            Overall, we saw that many accidents occur in normal “fine” weather and on dry roads,
            mostly because those conditions are most common. However, dark conditions, rain and
            wet surfaces still create clear risk and require extra care from both drivers and
            planners. Higher speed limits also appear more often in severe accidents, suggesting
            that speed management remains an important safety tool.
        </p>

        <p>
            These insights can support better road design, targeted enforcement and public
            awareness campaigns focused on high-risk places, times and conditions. The website
            provides a simple way for viewers to explore the data and start informed discussions
            about improving road safety in the United Kingdom.
