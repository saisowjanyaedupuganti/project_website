    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p>From this project we observed clear patterns in UK road accidents. Some days of the week and some locations show higher accident counts. Roads with higher speed limits are linked to more severe accidents. Weather, light and road surface conditions also influence the number of crashes and casualties.</p>

    <p>Map views highlight accident hotspots and areas with many vehicles involved. Time-based charts reveal trends over the years, and the scatter plot helps us see how vehicles and casualties are related. These insights can support better road design, traffic management and public safety campaigns.</p>

    <p>The website and charts are intended as a simple tool for exploring the data and starting discussions about how to improve road safety in the United Kingdom.</p>
