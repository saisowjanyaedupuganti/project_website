    <h1>UK Road Accident Analysis</h1>

    <h2>Project Topic</h2>
    <p>This project studies reported road accidents in the United Kingdom. We use the accident dataset to look at when and where crashes happen and how different conditions affect them.</p>

    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <p>The website is mainly for transport planners, traffic police, policy makers and anyone interested in road safety and accident patterns.</p>

    <h2>Main Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Which locations and days of the week have more accidents?</li>
        <li>How are speed limits related to accident severity?</li>
        <li>How do weather, light and road surface conditions influence accidents?</li>
        <li>What is the relationship between number of vehicles and number of casualties?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Dataset</h2>
    <p>The dataset includes fields such as Accident Index, Date, Day of Week, Latitude, Longitude, Weather Conditions, Light Conditions, Road Surface Conditions, Number of Vehicles and Number of Casualties.</p>
    <p>(In the written report you can show a small screenshot of a few rows from the CSV/Excel file here.)</p>
